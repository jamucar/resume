	<h3>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h3>
	<p>A <strong>seasoned software developer</strong> specialized in clean, scalable code production and maintenance.  Skilled in .NET, React and database architecture, with a solution-driven approach.  Committed to delivering high-quality results and staying abreast of industry trends and standards.</p>

	<h3>FUNCTIONAL EXPERTISE</h3>
	<ul class="skills">
		<li>C#</li>
		<li>SQL</li>
		<li>React</li>
		<li>GIT</li>
		<li>Agile Scrum</li>
		<li>.NET Framework</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>FUNCTIONAL EXPERTISE DEMONSTRATED</h3>
	<p><a title="iMiS" href="https://imispr.com/" >iMiS</a><br/>
	February 2020 - Present<br/>
	iMiS is a software solutions corporation with 8 employees and an annual 
	revenue of ~3 million.  The company specializes in distributing 
	<a href="https://www.aveva.com/" >AVEVA</a>
	products and developing tailor-made software solutions for pharmaceutical 
	and manufacturing companies, including notable clients such as Schering, Abbott, 
	Baxter, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Cordis, and AAA in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean..<br/>
	<strong>Full Stack Software Developer</strong><br/>
	Leads a cross-functional team in an Agile Scrum environment to develop client-specific applications. 
	My key responsibilities and areas of expertise include:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>C# | .NET: </strong>
			Utilizing C# and .NET, I create the server data rendering layer and modify identity 
			models to meet application security specifications. This involves considering user access, 
			locations, and roles based on Active Directory. 
			Data is supplied by either GraphQL (<a href="https://chillicream.com/" 
				>ChilliCream</a>) or 
			RestAPI.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Typescript | React: </strong>
			Designing user-friendly and responsive client interfaces, I develop
			applications that can run on the web browser or be locally installed 
			in computers and mobile devices.  When data is rendered by GraphQL, I
			leverage <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/" 
				>Apollo Client</a>, and when working with Rest API, I 
			utilize <a href="https://axios-http.com/docs/intro" 
				>Axios</a> for making HTTP requests and managing local state 
			<a href="https://mobx.js.org/README.html" >MobX</a>.
		</li>
		<li><strong>SQL: </strong>
			Designing the database architecture for the application, I ensure
			optimal data management. I work with
			<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/" 
				>Entity framework core</a>
			to achieve integration with the server layer, either by creating
			the database from migrations or by generating code from existing
			databases. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>RELEVANT PROJECTS</h3>
	<p>The following projects were specifically developed to ensure offline 
	functionality, taking into consideration the frequent hurricane strikes in 
	Puerto Rico, which can result in months of disrupted connectivity.  These
	projects allow extraction of data in Xlsx format and seamless importation 
	into the command operation center by users and administrators.  During normal 
	conditions, changes are automatically replicated. <br>
	<strong>LODOS: </strong>This project enables users to manage the creation of solid 
	wastethrough interactive forms, while service users can report the quantity 
	of solid waste retrieved from each plant.  Calculations are performed prior to 
	the drying process based on wastewater qualities and drying bed sizes.  User
	authorization is role and location-based. <br/>
	<strong>EOF-AAA: </strong>The objective of this project is to empower administrators, 
	regional users, and other roles to manage the state and data of potable water facilities, 
	generators, energy facilities, and energy complaints. Data rendering is facilitated by GraphQL, 
	employing the mediator design pattern.<br/>
	<strong>Informe-Diario: </strong>Users are able to submit daily reports on water 
	quality, including chlorine levels, turbidity, daily flow, and other calculated 
	values.  These values are compared against data captured by <a>Aveva Historian</a> 
	and must be reported monthly to the Health Department.  Data rendering in this 
	project is achived through RestAPI.
	<h3>PERSONAL PROJECTS</h3>
	<p>I like completing various CTF challenges, installing
	unconventional software, and reading:<br/>
	<a href = "https://libreboot.org/docs/hardware/e6400.html">
		<strong>Libreboot:</strong></a>
	Flash the ROM of DELL E6400. Surprisingly easy to do.<br/>
	<a href="https://suckless.org/">
		<strong>Suckless:</strong></a>
	Use dwm, dmenu, st and Surf browser.<br/>
	<a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/">
		<strong>Over The Wire NATAS:</strong></a>
	Learn website vulnerabilities and what mistakes you shouldn't make when programming. 
		The website is written in PHP, but the same concepts apply to other 
		languages. Can be completed with curl, basic Linux tools and scripting. <br/>
	<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/"/>
		<strong>OWASP Web Goat:</strong></a>
	Similar to NATAS but written in Java and more extensive. Run on localhost; 
		it's better to use a browser and an intercepting proxy, such as MITMPROXY.<br/>
	<a href="https://pwnable.kr/index.php">
		<strong>PWNABLE.KR:</strong></a>
	Mostly use of Linux tools, GDB, reverse engineering, binary exploitation. Ongoing project.<br/>
	<strong>The Art of Computational Programming: </strong>Books whose author needs no introduction. 
	Ongoing reading, probably for the rest of my life; use it as a reference for solving problems.
